# Build A Hello-World Program

At this point you should know some of the basics of the Java programming language and should be able to read Java code. You should also have the WPI Library, Git, and Sourcetree installed on your machine, and you should have a basic idea of how they work. If not, head back to the previous sections for more info.

## Hello-World

To test our skills and strengthen our Java expertise, we are going to build a simple program known as a ```Hello-World```. This is the most common way to start out with a programming language, and it is a great hands-on way to learn. Our ```Hello-World``` program will be a simple FRC command-based drivetrain project, which will be able to drive a robot using an Xbox style controller. Let's begin!

## Next Steps

Woo-Hoo! You should now have Git, Sourcetree, and the WPI Library installed on your computer, and you should also have a working program which can be deployed to a robot to drive it. Great work!.
