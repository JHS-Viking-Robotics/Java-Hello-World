# Install Software

Our team uses the following tools for software development:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - version control for our code
- [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) - graphical interface for ```git```
- [WPI Library](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/what-is-wpilib.html) - the official software tools for FRC
- [CTRE Phoenix Library](https://github.com/CrossTheRoadElec/Phoenix-Releases/releases) - software tools for CTRE hardware

If you are planning to use your own Windows 10, macOS, or Linux computer, you can go to the corresponding setup guide for your OS. If you are using a Chromebook, tablet, or some other computer, you should use the [Replit](/Install-Software/Replit.html) instructions. Note that you will not be able to deploy code to the robot or use Sourcetree, but everything else will work.

Additionally, if you are just looking to set up a new Driver Station computer for operating the robot, you can check out the first section in the [Windows 10 IDE and DS](/Java-Hello-World/Install-Software/Windows-10.html) instructions.
