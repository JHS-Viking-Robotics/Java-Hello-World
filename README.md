# Java Hello World

Are you trying to learn Java in order to program a FRC robot? Then you've come to the right place! This site can be viewed [here](https://jhs-viking-robotics.github.io/Java-Hello-World/).

## Development

If you want to develop this site locally, head over to the [GitHub Pages docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) for setup instructions.

Important note for macOS users, make sure to run ```bundle add webrick``` before serving the webpage for the first time, as there is a misconfigured dependency in the official instructions.

If you already are familiar with Jekyll and have it installed, you can simply run the following command to create a local webserver accessible at [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000):

```bash
cd docs && bundle exec jekyll serve
```
